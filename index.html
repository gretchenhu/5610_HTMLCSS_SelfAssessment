      <h2>Here is a list of 10 most useful tags for me in HTML</h2>
      <p>
        Side note: In HTML, a tag is used for creating an element, which may
        contain a data item or a chunk of text or an image, or perhaps nothing
        lol.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>ul: helps you create an unordered list</li>
        <li>
          ol: helps you created an ordered list, like the one you're seeing now
        </li>
        <li>
          div: the generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the
          content or layout until styled in some way using CSS
        </li>
        <li>
          span: The span element is a generic inline container for phrasing
          content, which doesn't mean anything but could be used to group
          elements for styling. It's very similar to div but div is block-level
          element whereas a span is an inline level element
        </li>
        <li>
          button: an interactive element activated by a user. Once activated, it
          then performs an action, such as submitting a form or opening a dialog
        </li>
        <li>
          form: represents a document section containing interactive controls
          for submitting information
        </li>
        <li>
          a: the anchor element, with its href attribute creates a yperlink to
          web pages, files, email addressess, locations in the same page, or
          anything else a URL can address
        </li>
        <li>
          meta: represents metadata that can't be represented by other HTML
          meta-related elements like base, script, style, or title
        </li>
        <li>nav: represents a sectino that provides navigation links</li>
        <li>
          script: used to embed executable code or data, typically used to embed
          or refer to JavaScript code
        </li>

      <h2>
        Here is a list of 10 important header tags that I should add to my pages
        for SEO optimization
      </h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Title: it appears as a clickable headline in the SERPs and also shows
          up on social networks and in browser
          <ul>
            <li>
              Give each page a unique title that describes the page's content
            </li>
            <li>Keep the titles up to 50-60 characters long</li>
            <li>Put important keywords first but in a natural manner</li>
            <li>
              Make use of your brand name in the title, even if it ends up not
              being showsn on the SERPs, it will still make a difference for the
              search engine
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Meta description tags: it's commonly displayed in a SERP snippet along
          with a title and page URL. Here are some tips on how to optimize your
          meta description tags:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Give each page a unique meta description that clearly reflects
              what value the page carries
            </li>
            <li>
              Google's snippets typically max out around 150-160 characters,
              including spaces
            </li>
            <li>
              Include your most significant keywords, so they could get
              highlighted on the actual SERP, but be careful to avoid keyword
              stuffing, don't make your description just a combination of
              keywords you're targeting
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Heading tags (H1-H6): they are used to identify headings and
          subheadings within your content from other types of text. Proper usage
          of H1 tag has been emphasized in many industry studies
          <ul>
            <li>
              Keep your headings relevant to the chunk of text they are
              describing
            </li>
            <li>
              Always have your headings reflect the sentiment of the text they
              are placed over
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Image alt attribute: it's important in terms of on-page optimization
          because alt text is displayed to visitors if the image cannot load,
          and it provide context because search engines can't "see" images
          <ul>
            <li>Keep the alt text clear and descriptive is important</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Nofollow attributes: external/outbound links are the links on your
          site pointing to other sites. These links make your content look like
          a hand-crafted comprehensive piece backed up by reliable sources, or
          make your site look like a pile of link dump that is trying to
          manipulate the algorithm, which Google does penalize. Therefore, it's
          very important to pay attention to where you link and how. Here are
          some links that you should not inlucde:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Links to any resources that in any way can be considered as
              "untrusted content"
            </li>
            <li>Any paid or sponsored links</li>
            <li>
              Links from comments or other kinds of user-generated content which
              can be spammed beyond your control
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Robot Meta Tag: you should close unnecessary or unfinished pages with
          thin content that have little value and no intent to appear in the
          SERPs. You should also close pages that unreasonably waster crawl
          budget
        </li>
        <li>
          rel="canonical" link tagL it's a way of telling search engines which
          version of a page you consider the main one and would like to be
          indexed by search engines and found by people. For SEO Optimization,
          you should put pages with similar content on the same subject
        </li>
        <li>
          Schema markup: it's a specific technique of organizing the data on
          each of your webpages in a way that's recognized by the search
          engines. Having a structured schema markup is a great boost to your
          UX, and carries huge SEO value.
        </li>
        <li>
          Social media meta tags: Open Graph let you control how a page would
          look when shared on social media. Some main Open Graph tags include
          og: title, og: url, og:description, og:image. You should consider
          adding basic and relevant metadata using Open Graph protocol, and test
          the URLs to see how they will be displayed
        </li>
        <li>

          scaled and displayed on any device. If you neglect this, your CTR and
          bounce rates could suffer
